These files were originally designed for deduplication for main memory
in Linux.

pageinfo.c is used to calculate hash for each individual physical page
while singlepage.c is used to export the content of a specified 
physical page. Both of these files work in Linux i386.

NUMA dir contains files for Linux x86_64.

analyze-pages is a perl script to give some statistics, just as the most
popular 20 hash values. 

The linux-header files should be installed, which are required for most of kernel modules.

=====
Compile:
	$ make
Install:
	$ sudo make install
destall:
	$ sudo make destall
reinstall:
	$ sudo reinstall

=====
Usage:
	After you have installed these two kernel modules, you will see two file
	entries in /proc. 

	1. To know hash values for each physical page, run
		$ cat /proc/pageinfo
	2. To see statistics about hash values for the physical pages, run
		$ cat /proc/pageinfo > perl analyze-pages
	3. To see content of a specific physical page, run

		$ echo physical_page_id > /proc/singlepage
		$ cat -v /proc/singlepage

	   You can also see the hex format of the content of this page, using 
	   dmesg.
